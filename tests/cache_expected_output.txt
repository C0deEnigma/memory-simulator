====================================================
EXPECTED OUTPUT — CACHE SIMULATOR TESTS
====================================================

Cache Configuration:
- L1: size=64, block=4, assoc=2, Number of sets=8
- L2: size=128, block=4, assoc=4, Number of sets=8
- Replacement Policies: FIFO and LRU
- Inclusive cache with promotion and demotion

----------------------------------------------------
TEST 1: BASIC HITS
----------------------------------------------------

Access Trace:
0, 64, 0

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- Access 0: L1 miss, L2 miss
- Access 64: L1 miss, L2 miss
- Access 0: L1 hit

EXPECTED STATS:
L1 hits: 1
L1 misses: 2
L2 hits: 0
L2 misses: 2

----------------------------------------------------
TEST 2: EVICTION AND DEMOTION
----------------------------------------------------

Access Trace:
0, 32, 64, 64, 0

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- 0 and 32 fill L1
- Access 64 causes L1 eviction and demotion of 0 to L2
- Second access to 64 is L1 hit
- Access 0 results in L2 hit and promotion to L1

EXPECTED STATS:
L1 hits: 1
L1 misses: 4
L2 hits: 1
L2 misses: 3

----------------------------------------------------
TEST 3: FIFO POLICY
----------------------------------------------------

Access Trace:
1, 33, 1, 65, 33

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR (FIFO):
- FIFO eviction order preserved
- 1 accessed later than 33 as well but since it the first one, it is evicted
- Access 65 causes eviction of earliest inserted block
- Final access to 33 results in L1 hit

EXPECTED STATS:
L1 hits: 2
L1 misses: 3
L2 hits: 0
L2 misses: 3

----------------------------------------------------
TEST 4: LRU POLICY
----------------------------------------------------

Access Trace:
1, 33, 1, 65, 33

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR (LRU):
- LRU eviction depends on most recent access
- 1 was accessed later so although it was the first one in deque but it was used more recently
- Hence, 33 evicted and demoted to L2
- Access 65 evicts least recently used block (33)
- Final access to 33 results in L2 hit

EXPECTED STATS:
L1 hits: 1
L1 misses: 4
L2 hits: 1
L2 misses: 3

----------------------------------------------------
TEST 5: STATS RESET
----------------------------------------------------

Access Trace:
0, 4

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- Initial stats reflect 2 accesses
- After resetStats(), all hit/miss counters reset to zero

EXPECTED STATS AFTER RESET:
L1 hits: 0
L1 misses: 0
L2 hits: 0
L2 misses: 0

----------------------------------------------------
END OF EXPECTED OUTPUT
